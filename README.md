# CV Template

> Code for my latest version of CV and, if needed, cover letter.

Built using [Overleaf](https://it.overleaf.com/).<br/>
Based on the LaTeX template **Awesome-CV**, to which all credit goes.

I have made some changes to customize it more: some options and functions are added/modified<br/>
in the `awesome-cv.cls` class and are highlighted with my GitHub username.

- Added `\grade` as loading dots
- Added `\tags` to use in descriptions
- Added support for both English and Italian language
- Possibility to add background image
- Possibility to add signature image at the bottom
- Some other minor changes

Examples of CV and cover letter are presented using non-personal data.
